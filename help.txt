#create a service:
kubectl create service clusterip --dry-run=client --tcp=3445:80 website -oyaml > website_service.yaml

#create a deployment:
kubectl create deployment --dry-run=client --image dsamist/website website -oyaml > website_deployment.yaml

#create an ingress
kubectl create ingress website --rule="mywebsite.com/=website:3445" --dry-run=client -oyaml > website_ingress.yaml

#to check if your helmchart is ok
helm show all ./chart (directory of the chart)
helm template --debug <chartName> <pathToValues>

#you can delete all k8 resources with the same selector
kubectl delete all -l app=<name> (add the namespace if there's a need to)

helm upgrade --atomic --install <name of app> </path to chart> ( what this does is to upgrade your application as a single unit (--atomic) and if the app doesn't exist before, it installs it as new (--install))
